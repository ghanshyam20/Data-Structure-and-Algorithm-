N = int(input("enter a number:"))
d = {}  # this is empty dict to store the value after squaring 

for i in range(1, N + 1):
    d[i] = i * i

print(d)


# this is simple python program to calculate the saquar as if i press number 6 it will print until the 6 and its square from 1 as key and value pair..
